### What is this repository for?  

AnimeSTProvider is a little python app which gets animes from your anime list at [MyAnimeList.net](http://myanimelist.net) *(right now it needs an html file with your list)*, then you can get search results for chosen anime from YouTube, add them to list and make them a YouTube playlist. You can also just manage your YouTube playlists.  
  
AnimeSTProvider runs on **Python 3.4**.  
  
Actual version: **1.0.1**  
  
I made this app to learn new things/develop my programming skills.
